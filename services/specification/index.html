      <h1>Needs Analysis and Technical Specification</h1>
          <p>Our Needs Analysis and Technical Specification services include two days of on-site consulting, where we work closely with your team to determine everything that needs to be done to get you up and running with Bricolage. We then provide you with a complete and detailed technical specification to guide the entire project through to launch.</p>
          <p>Our most popular and valuable service is a Needs Evaluation and Technical Specification. This service has two parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>First, one of our consultants will spend two days on-site, working with your team to analyze your site or new design layouts to identify each type of document for all sites to be managed in Bricolage. We will also review workflow processes, permissions requirements, types of output (XHTML, PHP, JSP, RSS, etc.), and document categorization.</p></li>
            <li><p>Based on the results of the needs analysis, we will create a complete technical specification that details every object that needs to be created in the Bricolage server, what optional features need to be enabled, and how the output templates are to be written. We work closely with you on the writing and revision of this document in order to create as comprehensive and solid a plan as possible.</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once your team has had a chance to review the technical specification and take advantage of your increasing understanding of how Bricolage works to make any necessary modifications, you will have a solid plan to guide the entire implementation process. </p>
          <p>Contact <a href="mailto:sales@kineticode.com">sales@kineticode.com</a> for an estimate.</p>
