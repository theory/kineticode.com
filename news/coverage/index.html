      <h3>Bricolage Developers Release 2.0</h3>
      <p>The Bricolage developers have released Bricolage 2.0. A revamped interface allows you to add fields (and groups of fields) to documents without leaving your current screen. You can drag to re-order elements and add categories and keywords via search-as-you-type autocompletion. Document definitions more flexible, so administrators can specify  minimum and maximum number of occurrences for any field or subelement. Other highlights include native thumbnail generation and streamlined job and event tracking. Bricolage now runs on both Apache 2 and Apache 1.3, and can use either PostgreSQL (8.1+) or MySQL (5.0.3+) as its repository.</p>
