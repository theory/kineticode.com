<h1>Kineticode Releases Bricolage 1.10</h1>
      <h2>Latest release offers revamped UI, PHP templating, LDAP authentication</h2>
      <p class="first"><span class="dateline">PORTLAND, Oregon &#x2014; January 23, 2006 &#x2014;</span> Kineticode and the Bricolage developer community today announced the immediate availability of version 1.10 of the Bricolage content management and publishing system. A major step forward, Bricolage 1.10 is the culmination of over 18 months of development, with contributions from a world-wide network of developers and contributors. The result is a streamlined user interface, improved enterprise authentication support, and native PHP templating, among other advances.</p>
      <p><q>This is a formidable release,</q> said David Wheeler, Bricolage architect, founder and president of Kineticode. <q>Many of the changes in Bricolage 1.10 are truly important, and a long time coming. Combined, they make for a more comprehensive, better designed, and more responsive user experience. Editors and administrators will be especially happy.</q></p>
      <p>The most visible of the over 90 changes in Bricolage 1.10 is the new user interface. Rendered by Web standards-compliant HTML, the Bricolage UI features page sizes up to 70% smaller than in previous releases. The result is a snappier, more flexible presentation that makes the best use of modern browsers. <q>The ability to expand your browser window and have the UI expand along with it alone was worth the effort,</q> Wheeler said.</p>
      <p>But perhaps the most exciting addition to Bricolage is PHP templating. <q>We have always been able to use Bricolage&#x2019;s excellent Mason templating architecture,</q> said Celso Martinho, CTO of PT.COM, the Internet leaders in Portugal, and sponsors of the Bricolage PHP project. <q>And now, with native PHP templating built into Bricolage, our entire developer staff can create of output templates for <a href="http://sapo.pt/" title="SAPO&#x2014;Portugal Online!">SAPO</a>, <a href="http://dn.pt/" title="Diário de Notícias">Diário de Notícias</a>, and <a href="http://jn.pt/" title="Jornal de Notícias">Jornal de Notícias</a>.</q></p>
      <p>Native PHP support in Bricolage&#x2014;a Perl application&#x2014;was made possible by the development of an important new technology, known as <q>PHP::Interpreter</q>, that embeds a PHP 5 interpreter inside a Perl 5 interpreter. As a result, PHP code run by the PHP::Interpreter runs in a native PHP 5 environment, but can also transparently make use of any and all Perl libraries, including the complete Bricolage API. The result is a powerful programming language mashup that is sure to push Bricolage into new settings, as well as to foster greater collaboration between the Perl and PHP communities. <q>PHP::Interpreter is truly an astonishing piece of work,</q> added PT.COM&#x2019;s Martinho. <q>We&#x2019;re very proud to <a href="http://softwarelivre.sapo.pt" title="softwarelivre.sapo.pt">contribute</a> work such as this back to the Open Source Community.</q></p>
      <p>Wheeler also highlighted Bricolage 1.10&#x2019;s new editing environment. <q>Because Bricolage enforces highly structured documents, it has not been possible to edit an entire document in a single interface,</q> said Wheeler. <q>The incredible new Bulk Edit interface finally allows writers to work on entire documents in a single editing environment. They can use our new find and replace dialog box to move things along, while preserving the integrity of the document structure.. I personally have already made much use of the new editor, and can&#x2019;t wait for others to enjoy it, as well.</q></p>
      <p>One other stand out feature of Bricolage 1.10 is support for LDAP authentication, which is sure to please IT administrators who rely on directory services for single sign-on to the applications they manage. <q>We&#x2019;ve been using it internally for months with our directory server without a single a problem. It&#x2019;s great to have Bricolage so well integrated into our IT infrastructure,</q> added Wheeler.</p>
