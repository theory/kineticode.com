      <h2>Signs New Clients: ETonline, RAND Corporation, Dean for America, Radio Free Asia</h2>
      <p><span class="dateline">SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. &#x2014; November 5, 2003 &#x2014;</span> Kineticode, the leading provider of Bricolage Content Management System consulting and support services, announced today that its final quarter of 2003 will be its most successful to date. With solid growth in its client base and steady advances in new releases of Bricolage, Kineticode is positioned to continue its rapidly expanding presence in the CMS market. </p>
      <p>In September 2003, Entertainment Tonight successfully re-launched its Web site, ETonline (<a href="http://www.ETonline.com/">www.ETonline.com</a>), utilizing the Bricolage content management system. With over 15,000 articles, ETonline is a large, high-volume Web site featuring the latest entertainment news, celebrity interviews, and coverage of TV, movie, DVD and music releases. ETonline recognized the capabilities of Bricolage to meet the needs of its current and projected demands and selected Kineticode to implement its content management solution with Bricolage. <q>Kineticode&#x2019;s services were very helpful,</q> said Kevin Elliott, technical producer at ETonline. <q>It&#x2019;s refreshing to work with people who are so smart. It makes for productive discourse and rapid problem solving,</q> Elliott added.</p>
      <p><q>ETonline&#x2019;s Web site is the most complex and dynamic that Bricolage has managed to date,</q> said David Wheeler, president of Kineticode. <q>It gives me tremendous satisfaction to see Bricolage rise to the challenge. It&#x2019;s an exceptional confirmation of the value Bricolage provides, as a flexible, scalable open-source application, coupled with outstanding professional services. I&#x2019;m delighted that Kineticode was able to partner with ETonline to provide such a successful solution.</q></p>
      <p>Kineticode has also been selected by the RAND Corporation (<a href="http://www.rand.org/">www.rand.org</a>), Dean for America (<a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/">www.deanforamerica.com</a>), and Radio Free Asia (<a href="http://www.rfa.org/">www.rfa.org</a>). RAND needed a better solution for managing its catalog of publications, as well as an automated content management system that would enable a smooth transition from maintaining its extensive Web site by hand. With Bricolage, RAND found a product flexible enough to manage multiple sites and provide the efficiency necessary to focus on new development. Kineticode is managing RAND&#x2019;s transition to Bricolage, beginning with an in-depth needs analysis, generating templates, and providing on-site training. RAND expects to launch its first Bricolage-powered site by the end of 2003, with other related RAND sites to follow.</p>
      <p><q>Bricolage is a powerful tool, and being able to get support directly from the maintainer makes it easy to access that power,</q> said Neal Sofge, RAND Web Technical Manager. <q>The system was able to accommodate our unique requirements and constraints, while adapting to our existing workflow.</q></p>
      <p>The Dean for America site is extremely high-volume, and the number of visits to the site is growing every day. The new Bricolage-powered site will enable maximum performance by publishing all content to an external Web server, which can scale to meet server loads independent of Bricolage. Additionally, the browser-based interface provides a familiar, easy-to-use environment, which will enable the Dean staff to produce and publish documents without any knowledge of HTML.</p>
      <p><q>We&#x2019;re really excited to be moving to Bricolage,</q> said Nicco Mele, Webmaster, Dean for America. <q>Our server loads can go through the roof toward the end of each quarter. For us, Bricolage will have a tremendously positive impact on our scalability, allowing us to manage our content independent of our front-end servers, which will be focused on getting our message to the voters.</q> Dean for America expects to be running on Bricolage by mid-November 2003.</p>
      <p>Kineticode has also begun working with Radio Free Asia (RFA) to implement a Bricolage-powered content management solution for the multilingual RFA site. While still in the needs analysis and specifications phase, Kineticode will ensure that RFA can manage and publish documents in more than 10 languages. The project will build upon the existing templating system, thus easing the transition and greatly extending RFA&#x2019;s site management and development capabilities. RFA &#x2014; funded by Congress with a mandate to broadcast exhaustive, unbiased news to Asian countries that lack free media &#x2014; has seen a 50 percent increase in site traffic over the last year. The upgraded RFA site is expected to go live in January 2004.</p>
      <p>Wheeler expressed his excitement that Kineticode is working with such a high caliber and diverse client base. <q>We believe in Bricolage and the power of open source models to rewrite the rules of user-driven and continuous growth in software capacity, coupled with cost-efficiency. It is extremely encouraging to see high-profile clients embracing Kineticode and Bricolage for their content management needs.</q>  </p>
      <p>Wheeler, who also serves as the lead developer and maintainer of Bricolage, will be participating in a panel discussion, <q>The Highs and Lows of Content Management Systems,</q> at the World Organization of Webmasters (WOW, <a href="http://www.joinwow.org/">www.joinwow.org</a>) Web Services Conference at COMDEX Las Vegas on Thursday, November 20, 2003 at 2 pm. This session will cover current CMS technologies and offer a range of alternatives for developers struggling to find effective management solutions for site content. Wheeler will also be delivering a presentation on Bricolage at the WOW booth (<strong>COMDEX Booth #6842</strong>) on <strong>Wednesday, November 19, 2003 at 11:30 a.m.,</strong> demonstrating some of the many facets of the Bricolage content management solution.</p>
