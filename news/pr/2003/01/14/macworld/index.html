      <h2>Smooth transition, CMS flexibility and ease-of use touted as keys to successful launch</h2>
      <p><span class="dateline">SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. &#x2014; January 14, 2003 &#x2014;</span> Kineticode today announced that its partnership with Mac Publishing has culminated in the re-launch of the Macworld Magazine Web site (<a href="http://www.macworld.com/" target="new">www.macworld.com</a>) managed by the Bricolage content management system. By drawing on the power and flexibility of Bricolage and the expertise provided by Kineticode, Mac Publishing has successfully and transparently launched a new version of the popular Macworld Web site.</p>
      <p><q>Launching a site managed by a new content management system is no small task,</q> said Sean Greathouse, Mac Publishing&#x2019;s IT Director. <q>But with Kineticode&#x2019;s excellent implementation and support services, this project has been a solid success.</q> Greathouse also highlighted the elegance of the Bricolage user interface as an important component of that success. <q>In Bricolage, we found a system that allows our editors to easily manage content across multiple sites. The browser-based interface is fast, easy to use, and cross-platform compatible, while the powerful templating tools give our Web team system-wide control over the appearance and behavior of our sites.</q></p>
      <p><q>The launch of the Bricolage-managed Macworld Web site is a tremendous validation of the power and flexibility of well-written, scalable open-source software,</q> said David Wheeler, President of Kineticode. <q>I&#x2019;m pleased that Kineticode was able to partner with Mac Publishing to provide the expertise required to complete the successful and affordable rollout of an enterprise content management solution that meets the needs of such a fast-moving and active publishing company.</q></p>
      <p>Key to the success of the Bricolage roll-out is Mac Publishing&#x2019;s sponsorship of the development of new Bricolage features. Much of the code written by Kineticode for Mac Publishing will be contributed back to the Bricolage open-source project, to be included in a future release of Bricolage. <q>We hope that Mac Publishing&#x2019;s willingness to sponsor new Bricolage development will set a healthy precedent for cooperation between open-source and business interests, to the benefit of all,</q> Wheeler said.</p>
      <p>Kineticode and Mac Publishing also plan to collaborate on the migration of the MacCentral Web site (<a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/" target="new">maccentral.macworld.com</a>) to Bricolage within the next two to three months. The aim is to manage all of Mac Publishing&#x2019;s existing and new content exclusively via the open-source content management system.</p>
