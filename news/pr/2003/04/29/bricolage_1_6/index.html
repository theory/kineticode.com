      <h2>New features, increased performance mark significant new release</h2>
      <p><span class="dateline">SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. &#x2014; April 29, 2003 &#x2014;</span> Kineticode today announced the release of Bricolage 1.6, a significantly advanced version of the critically acclaimed open source content management system. With more than 80 new features and improvements, version 1.6 is the best performing, most scalable version of Bricolage released to date.</p>
      <p><q>This is the most robust version of Bricolage yet,</q> stated David Wheeler, Bricolage lead developer, founder and president of Kineticode. <q>This release reflects the efforts of numerous individuals and organizations around the world, and is the result of more than seven months of collaboration. Kineticode is pleased to deliver version 1.6 as the culmination of this effort.</q></p>
      <p>New or improved features in Bricolage 1.6 include complete support for localization, with Portuguese and Italian translations; fully editable document model fields; greater flexibility for managing the URLs of documents published through Bricolage Output Channels; a new content editing interface, called <q>Super Bulk Edit,</q> for editing the parts of a document element in one interface; document distribution via WebDAV and Secure FTP; and much more.</p>
      <p><q>We&#x2019;re thrilled with this new version of Bricolage,</q> said Sara Wood, electronic publishing manager for the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland (<a href="http://www.who.int/" target="new">www.who.int</a>). <q>It vastly improves the performance of our content management infrastructure while providing an enhanced templating environment that greatly simplifies our template code. We could not be more pleased with this upgrade.</q> Wood also highlighted the new localization support introduced with the release of Bricolage 1.6. <q>WHO needs to manage documents in a number of languages. The ability to provide the interface in different languages is invaluable for our user community.</q></p>
      <p>Mac Publishing&#x2019;s information technology Director, Sean Greathouse, hailed Bricolage 1.6 as an important development for Macworld, as well (<a href="http://www.macworld.com/" target="new">www.macworld.com</a>). <q>This release introduces many new features that are essential for effectively managing Macworld.com and MacCentral.com,</q> said Greathouse. <q>It&#x2019;s now much easier for us to manage the different URL formats for the two sites via Bricolage Output Channels, and to interlink multipage documents via the improved Burner API. We&#x2019;re pleased that our collaboration with Kineticode has culminated in the release of Bricolage 1.6.</q></p></p>
