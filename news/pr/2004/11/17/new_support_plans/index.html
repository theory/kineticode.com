      <h2>Multiple levels of support round out expanded offerings</h2>
      <p><span class="dateline">PORTLAND, Oregon &#x2014; November 17, 2004 &#x2014;</span> Kineticode, the leading provider of Bricolage Content Management System consulting and support services, today launched a new suite of comprehensive Bricolage <a href="/support/" title="Kineticode Support">support plans</a>. With a broader array of support services for technical, templating, and software maintenance support, Kineticode has expanded the reach of its offerings to larger and more diverse organizations.</p>
      <p><q>We&#x2019;re pleased to be able to expand our services to new markets and opportunities,</q> said David Wheeler, president of Kineticode. <q>As enterprises adopt Bricolage to more content, Kineticode will be there to provide the support needed to ensure quick resolution to technical and templating issues.</q></p>
      <p>Kineticode now provides three different types of Bricolage support plans: technical support, which covers administration, usage, database problems, and other unexpected technical issues; templating support, which provides assistance and sample code for template development issues; and software maintenance, wherein Kineticode will perform regular minor version upgrades of its customers&#x2019; Bricolage servers.</p>
      <p>In addition, there are now multiple technical support options: Bronze Level, Silver Level, Gold Level, and Platinum Level support. These plans vary in their levels of support, response times, numbers of incidents, and consulting discounts, and are designed to provide a scale of options from which an enterprise can select the plan appropriate to the scale of its organization. Custom support plans are also available.</p>
