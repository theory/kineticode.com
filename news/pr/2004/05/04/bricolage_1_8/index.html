      <h2>New version of critically acclaimed CMS delivers Multi-site support, dramatic performance increases</h2>
      <p><span class="dateline">PORTLAND, Oregon &#x2014; May 4, 2004 &#x2014;</span> Kineticode and the Bricolage developer community are pleased to announce the availability of version 1.8 of the Bricolage Content Management System (CMS). This major release is the culmination of over a year of development, with contributions from a world-wide network of developers and contributors. It improves upon Bricolage&#x2019;s feature set and performance to better serve the needs of the enterprise-grade CMS market, while maintaining its status as an open-source content management leader.</p>
      <p><q>I&#x2019;m extremely pleased with this release,</q> said David Wheeler, Bricolage lead developer, founder and president of Kineticode. <q>A lot of hard work from numerous developers has resulted in substantial improvements to the performance of Bricolage, while making version 1.8 the most flexible and customizable open-source CMS on the market. If you&#x2019;ve been holding off on implementing a CMS solution for your organization, the time has arrived with Bricolage 1.8.</q></p>
      <p>Version 1.8 includes a bevy of new features and enhancements that improve the power, scalability, and flexibility of Bricolage for large organizations. One of the most important improvements is the new support for managing an unlimited number of sites from a single installation of Bricolage, with each site having its own categories, templates, document types, and workflows. Collaboration across sites is supported by document aliasing and shared workflow desks.</p>
      <p><q>We&#x2019;re very excited by the new developments in Bricolage 1.8,</q> stated João Pedro Gonçalves, manager of research and development for Internet at Portugal Telecom, the Internet leaders in Portugal. <q>The new multisite support provides an ideal solution for us to manage many sites from a single installation of Bricolage. We&#x2019;re already using it in production, and look forward to rolling out Bricolage-powered sites throughout our organization.</q></p>
      <p>Among over 110 improvements to Bricolage, a few new features stand out. These include: significant performance boosts to search queries and URI uniqueness validation; email distribution; a greatly simplified templating API; template sandboxes to enable template development without interfering with production templates; support for Template Toolkit templates (<a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/" title="Visit the Template Toolkit Web site">www.template-toolkit.org</a>); new <q>Publish</q> and <q>Recall</q> permissions, for improved workflow management; per-user preferences; document formatting at publish time, rather than publish scheduling time; new German and Mandarin localizations; image thumbnails and icons for all media documents; and support for HTMLArea WYSIWYG editing (<a href="http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/" title="Visit the HTMLArea Web site">www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/</a>).</p>
      <p><q>The new templating and sandbox features have proven invaluable to us,</q> said Nate Perry-Thistle, director of technology for Performance Learning Systems (<a href="http://www.plsweb.com/" title="Visit the Performance Learning Systems Web site">www.plsweb.com</a>). <q>Creating a new template has never been easier. We can exercise and verify every condition before checking in or deploying the template, and thanks to the templating sandbox, we can easily fix template bugs without introducing any instability into the existing publishing process. Bricolage templating has never gone more smoothly.</q></p>
      <p>Neal Sofge, web technical manager for the RAND Corporation (<a href="http://www.rand.org/" title="Visit the RAND Web site">www.rand.org</a>) highlighted the simplified interface for accessing content from within templates. <q>The output for our site can get pretty complex</q> Sofge related. <q>We&#x2019;re pleased with the new release, as it will greatly simplify many of our templates, making them easier to manage going forward. Bricolage 1.8 is a big win for us.</q></p>
